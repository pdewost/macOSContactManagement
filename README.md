# macOSContactManagement
An AppleScript project to clean macOS Contacts application mess using contact's notes.

## Working with the repository

The AppleScript modules are saved as plain text files so they can be easily versioned. To use them on macOS:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Open `Contact Management - v0.9.4/contact-manager.txt` in Script Editor.
3. Open `contact-operations.txt` and `utilities.txt` from the same folder and save each one as a compiled script (`contact-operations.scpt` and `utilities.scpt`).
4. Compile and run the `contact-manager` script. It will automatically load the compiled modules and perform the cleaning operations on your Contacts database.

You may rename the `.txt` files to `.applescript` if you prefer syntax highlighting while editing.
